I am a PhD student in the [Mike Hickerson](https://hickerlab.wordpress.com/) and [Ana Carnaval](https://carnavallab.org) labs at the City University of New York, City College campus, supported as a [Graduate Center Digital Fellow](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/). I am interested in understanding how populations evolve in response to changing environments. [Support BIPOC in STEM.](https://www.shutdownstem.com/)
