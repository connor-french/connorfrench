<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of insects in the world. Like a lot a lot. Recent estimates put </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/24/7519.short"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the number of insect species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a whopping 5.5 million. Only about a million have names, leaving the other 4.5 million or so species undescribed. To put this into context, there are </span><a href="https://amphibiaweb.org/amphibian/speciesnums.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8,053 described amphibian species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the projected number of undescribed species remains in the thousands. While I consider all life to be equally important (and I’m particularly fond of amphibians- I mean, just </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS832US832&amp;biw=1343&amp;bih=650&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=6XpJXc7tOayv_Qac8oGQBA&amp;q=ranitomeya&amp;oq=ranitomeya&amp;gs_l=img.3..35i39l2j0i67l2j0l6.53933.55501..55948...0.0..1.371.943.9j3-1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.ujvBzQEfoC8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOhpG-p-7jAhWsV98KHRx5AEIQ4dUDCAY&amp;uact=5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">look at these</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), the gap in our understanding of insect diversity is especially concerning. They’re important for </span><a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/plantsanimals/pollinate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0qm_L_HPdM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flowering plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/insects/ambb/abb_fact.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decomposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a host of other functions. Without a firm understanding of existing insect diversity, scientists can’t accurately determine the causes of </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/why-insect-populations-are-plummeting-and-why-it-matters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapid declines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in insect populations across the globe. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, describing 4.5 million species of insect is an onerous task. That’s why, as part of my PhD dissertation, I’m devising a new metric of diversity that skirts around this problem. Although I would love to go into excruciating detail about what it is, I’ll leave that up to my dissertation chapter. Briefly, I use </span><a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Fact-Sheet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNA sequences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from insects collected by researchers from </span><a href="http://www.boldsystems.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">across the globe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to summarize the </span><a href="http://b4fa.org/bioscience-in-brief/plantbreeding/genetic-diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">genetic diversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of insect communities, rather than their species diversity. This makes data collection much more feasible across a broad scale. However, exactly what it tells us about insect communities is still uncertain.</span>

Warmer colors indicate densely sampled areas. </font>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To remedy this, I’m using </span><a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-learning-ML"><span style="font-weight: 400;">machine learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Machine learning, the part-statistics, part-algorithmic wizardry that helps Snapchat </span><a href="https://medium.com/cracking-the-data-science-interview/snapchats-filters-how-computer-vision-recognizes-your-face-9907d6904b91"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn your face into an alien</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Facebook </span><a href="https://research.fb.com/blog/category/machine-learning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommend you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> custom underwear, can also be used to answer important scientific questions. In a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/12/what-is-biodiversity-and-why-does-it-matter-to-us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biodiversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> context, machine learning can help clarify what about the environment, whether that is climate, topography, human-mediated habitat loss, etc., best predicts a selected metric of diversity. In my project planning stages, I decided to use this approach to assess the relationships my new metric has with other global-scale processes. However, I only had a rudimentary knowledge of the capabilities of a machine learning approach. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I decided to take the </span><a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/02/06/rstudio-conf-2019-workshops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied Machine Learning in R</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two-day workshop in Austin, Texas. The workshop’s goal was to “step through the process of building, visualizing, testing, and comparing models that are based on prediction.” This was exactly what I needed. Unfortunately, since it was a part of an industry conference for tech professionals, the </span><a href="https://www.rstudio.com/conference/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rstudio::conf2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it was prohibitively expensive. Luckily, I was able to secure a </span><a href="https://digitalgrants.commons.gc.cuny.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provost’s Digital Innovation Training Grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which covered the costly tuition. As a University of Texas at Austin alumni, I easily found a couch to crash on, which cut expenses significantly. The prime location and generous help from the </span><a href="https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GC Digital Initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> paved my way to the workshop. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In between eating </span><a href="http://www.vaquerotaquero.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">street tacos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and taking dips at </span><a href="https://www.austintexas.org/listings/barton-springs-pool/4687/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barton Springs Pool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I learned the basics of performing machine learning analyses in </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYUGMg_14s"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a programming language centered around statistical analysis. Going in, I had a strong background in R, but I did not have a working knowledge of machine learning. The workshop’s </span><a href="https://github.com/topepo/rstudio-conf-2019"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exercises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/max-kuhn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gave me more confidence in using the machine learning techniques I was already familiar with and introduced me to algorithms I had never heard of. It was one of these new algorithms– I point out it’s named </span><a href="https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/mars.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MARS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the statistically and astronomically inclined– that I decided to use for my dissertation chapter. It strikes a balance between predictive power and explanatory ease that I am aiming for in my project. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After some months of pulling my hair out, working through the kinks of how to wrangle 4.7 million insect DNA sequences, I was able to use my new machine learning skills to perform preliminary analyses of my data. The results, which I presented as a </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nhvskh6xarg6ej/poster_ConnorFrench.pdf?dl=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the </span><a href="https://www.evolutionmeetings.org/evolution-2019---providence.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conference in Providence, Rhode Island, point toward my metric being a useful summary of insect biodiversity. I received numerous bits of positive feedback that I am currently using to finalize my analyses and publish this work in a professional journal. Initially, I thought this project would take up a large chunk of my PhD, but with the help of the Applied Machine Workshop and GC Digital Initiatives, I was able to jumpstart my analyses and will put out a stronger product, sooner. In due course, I hope my research leads to a stronger understanding of insect diversity and how us humans are impacting it.</span>
